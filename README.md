### TE SEM-V Computer Engineering SPPU 2019 Pattern ####
This repository contains laboratory assignments, source codes, and syllabus resources for the Third Year (TE) Computer Engineering course at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), following the 2019 Pattern.

Repository Overview
The content covers practical assignments for Semester 5, specifically focusing on Laboratory Practice 1 (LP-1), Computer Network Security (CNS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), and Internet of Things (IoT).

Directory Structure
**1. LP-1 (Laboratory Practice 1)**
This directory focuses on System Programming and Operating System (SPOS) concepts.

**Group A (System Programming):**

Assembler implementation.

Macro Processor design.

Dynamic Link Library (DLL) operations.

**Group B (Operating System):**

CPU Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin).

Memory Placement Strategies (First Fit, Best Fit, Next Fit, Worst Fit).

Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal).

Resources:

Lab Manuals and Syllabus copies.

**2. CNS (Computer Network Security)**
This directory includes implementations of networking protocols and algorithms using C, C++, and Java, as well as Cisco Packet Tracer simulations.

Socket Programming: Calculator and Hello World Client-Server architecture (TCP/UDP).

Protocols:

Sliding Window Protocols (Go-Back-N ARQ, Selective Repeat).

Routing Algorithms (Distance Vector).

File Transfer implementations.

Network Utilities:

DNS Lookup.

Subnet Mask and Subnetting logic.

Error Detection (Hamming Code).

Simulations: Packet Tracer (.pkt) experiment files.

**3. DBMS (Database Management Systems)**
Contains laboratory assignments related to database management, SQL queries, and normalization.

**4. IOT-LAB (Internet of Things)**
Contains codes and assignments related to IoT architecture, sensors, and connectivity.

Prerequisites and Tools
To execute the codes in this repository, the following tools are required:

GCC/G++ Compiler (for C and C++ programs)

Java Development Kit (JDK)
